Building Pre-requisites pybind11 must be installed and able to be located by CMake. A relatively recent Python3 installation CMake variables MLIR_BINDINGS_PYTHON_ENABLED:BOOL
Enables building the Python bindings. Defaults to OFF.
MLIR_PYTHON_BINDINGS_VERSION_LOCKED:BOOL
Links the native extension against the Python runtime library, which is optional on some platforms. While setting this to OFF can yield some greater deployment flexibility, linking in this way allows the linker to report compile time errors for unresolved symbols on all platforms, which makes for a smoother development workflow.</description></item></channel></rss>
